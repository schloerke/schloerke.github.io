			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
FaceOff is a game that is designed to help calibrate your eyes into viewing and thinking in the fourth dimension. The game arose from discussions between David Bulger and Dr. Dianne Cook, in 2004, as a first attempt to grow a 2-D game into higher dimensions. It has been further developed by Spencer Bradley, Dr. Hadley Wickham , Dr. Heike Hofmann and myself. <br />
<br />
The goal of the game is to connect a square in a 4-D cube with all four corners painted with your color. The game is a combination of 'Connect 4', 'Tic Tac Toe', and 'Dots and Lines', only it is played in 4-D.  It is similar to 'Connect 4' in that you need all four dots of your color, 'Dots and Lines' in that you make a square, and the strategies from 'Tic Tac Toe'. </p>
