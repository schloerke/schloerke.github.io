			<h1>Election Maps</h1>
			<h2>Source</h2>
			<p>All of the graphics shown below are housed from Dianne Cooks website on <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~dicook/Election/Home.html" target="_blank">Election data</a>.</p>
			<h2>Cartogram</h2>
			<p>The cartogram shows voting pattern in a way that is more representative of the electoral votes while maintaining some geographic relations.  The cartogram is block-constructed, coded, and imported into R. It demonstrates the states' area in proportion to its electoral votes. For example, Montana only has an area of three votes, while Rhode Island has an area of four votes even though it is much smaller geographically.</p>

			<h2>Electoral Vote Towers</h2>
			<p>New ways to display data are a lot of fun.  The graph below was inspired by a New York Times display during the 2000 presidential election titled "Building an Election Victory".  These displays show the sum of the electoral votes for each canidate.  The shape comes from each state's percent difference (horizontal), and elelectoral votes (vertical).  While the colors may be redundant, it still helps categorize the states' voting percentages. The goal of the candidates is to reach the 270 votes needed to win the presidency which corresponds to the towers building up to the 270th line.  Each of the states that are still a toss-up have their relevant statistics reported on the candidate's side to which they are currently learning.<br><br>
			Since the data was taken from polls that have higher percentages of error, 3-4%, a graph was made to display the states that had a difference greater than 5% (top graph).  For curoisity's sake, we also made a graph of the states with a difference greater than 2% (bottom graph).<p>
